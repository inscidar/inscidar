# Interactive Science Data Accessibility Report

This website showcases the results of the [Life Sciences Accessibility Evaluation](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/life-sciences-a11y-evaluation).

## Development

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Data Availability
The data resides in [this repository](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/life-sciences-a11y-evaluation/tree/main/data). It is not yet linked, so the data products are copied over. The zip folders (necessary for bulk downloads) are created with a script that can be run with:

```sh
bash create_zips.sh
```
